##### /data has inputs and results. pngs and txts for 2,268 experiments reside at /data/results/run*/
##### /scripts jupyter notebooks are ordered by number (ie. start with 1)
##### _.sh (in /scripts) uses cluster resources to load run.py, which computes the bulk experiments.
##### run.py calls f2f.py from /scripts/trapdoor and is connected to runpng and runtxt
